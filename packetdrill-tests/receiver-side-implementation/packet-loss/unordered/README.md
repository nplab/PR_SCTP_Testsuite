# Notes
1. The Linux Kernel Implememtation sends correct but slightly out-of-date informations in the SACK-Chunk, because it seems
   to first process the FORwARD-TSN-Chunk and sends directly a SACK-CHUNK without looking at the bundled DATA-Chunk.
2. The FreeBSD Kernel Implementation does not allow to receive the available user messages before the first fragmented user message was 
   fully received by the kernel.
