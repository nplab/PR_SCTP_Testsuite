Precondition:
IUT supports PR-SCTP. 
Association where PR-SCTP is enabled is established between tester and IUT.
Let the IUT send a single user message in four DATA-Chunks, each in its own packet. Send a SACK for the first two DATA-Chunks at the tester. 
Then wait so long until the T3-rtx timer of the sender expires and flags the third DATA-Chunk as abandoned.

Purpose:
Ensure that the IUT sends a valid FORWARD TSN-Chunk and bundles it with the fourth DATA-Chunk.
